# DrConverters: unified cotranscriptional folding output.

This repository contains scripts to convert the output of different
cotranscriptional folding simulators into the \*.drf file format.
This format is used for visualization by the JavaScript application [DrForna],
and it can also be plotted in various flavors by the Python script `DrPlotter`
from the [DrTransformer] package for cotranscriptional folding.

## Installation
The sripts provided in this repository can be installed using:
```sh
pip install .
```
**Note:** This repository only provides functions to convert output from other
programs, as well as **wrapper scripts** to call those programs and convert
output automatically. The respective dependencies must be installed separately (see below).

### Dependencies

#### Kinfold [[Flamm et al. (2000)]] & ViennaRNA [[Lorenz et al. (2011)]]
[Kinfold] is part of the [ViennaRNA package], which can be installed via
bioconda. First, make sure bioconda is set up properly with:
```sh
  ~$ conda config --add channels defaults
  ~$ conda config --add channels bioconda
  ~$ conda config --add channels conda-forge
  ~$ conda config --set channel_priority strict
```
Second, install or update your ViennaRNA installation.
```sh
  ~$ conda install 'viennarna>=2.5.1'
```

#### Kinefold [[Xayaphoummine et al. (2005)]]
[Kinefold] must be downloaded (follow the link [Kinefold]). It is important
to have the executable `kinefold_long_static` placed in the working directory
where `DrKinefold` is used.

### Testing
Test the functionality of wrapper scripts via:

```sh
DrKinfold --help
DrKinefold --help
```

## Contributing
Did you find a bug? Or do you want to provide support for a different
cotranscriptional folding software? Please fork the repository and submit
a pull request. 


## Cites
The program wrappers provided in this repository use published software. Use
them at your own risk -- ask if you have questions -- and do not forget to cite the original software:
- `DrKinfold` depends on [Kinfold], publised in [Flamm et al. (2000)]
- `DrKinefold` depends on [Kinefold], published in [Xayaphoummine et al. (2005)]

The \*.drf output format was primarily developed for [DrForna] visualization.
If you find this visualization helpful during your analysis, consider citing
[Tanasie et al. (2023)].

The program `DrPlotter` provides additional Python visualization options, it is
part of the [DrTransformer] Python package, which should be cited as [Badelt et
al. (2023)].
